Welcome & Class expectations

Hi Class,
Welcome to Web Concepts. I hope you're ready to learn, because this course moves FAST!

My name is Yukiko Ishida and apart from teaching, I am a Visual Designer working in San Fransico for Snapfish by HP. I love technology and love web design even with all of its quirks, so if you see anything cool and interesting on the web, do share! I also play indoor soccer, videogames and go bicycling whenever I have free time (not much unfortunately).

I hope to help you all gain some understanding of the process and techniques involved with web-design. The web design industry evolves very quickly, but by learning the fundamentals, you can apply your skills to the latest and greatest.



My schedule and contact info:
yukiko.ishida.aau@gmail.com
I work normal office hours, but will check in briefly at the beginning (9am) and end of my day (6pm) for direct questions via email. I prefer messages through gmail as opposed to the online course mailbox since I can send/receive on my phone (on the bus!). I will also appear online at times through gmail chat so don't hesitate to ask a quick question there!

Your schedule and contact info:
Please send me your email address so I can directly send you updates and announcements. It also helps to notify me if you're sick or need help completing an assignment on time. Don't hesitate to ask for help- there are tutoring services available, but you'll need my referral. Falling behind (especially in the beginning) will set you back the most.




Discussion:
Posting:
 - When posting a design for review, please attach the image to the actual post rather than in the body of your message. There should be a "Review" link at the bottom of your post.
 - If you're asking for code help please post several items: 
 	- a link to the page (so we can look at the code)
 	- a mockup of the page (so we can see what you're trying to do).
 	- a description on where you think things are wrong. "I'm trying to make my link red, but it stays white. Is the code on line 20 incorrect?"
 - Remember, always try googling a code question before asking others. You may find your answer in less time than it takes to post the question!


Replying: 
 - Please review your classmate's designs and help them through their coding problems.
 - Be critical (but constructive) of your classmates. Ten comments of "I love your design!" doesn't help your classmates improve. It helps to give thoughtful comments sandwiching good/bad/suggestion types of advice. For example, "I love the green flower motif. However, your bright yellow text becomes illegible against the green. Maybe you should change the yellow to something darker like black to provide more contrast."
 - Don't hit the reply button! Click on the review images link to comment. The review images link will show multiple student's comments all together!




Assignments:
Read the book, readings, and then the module content. They'll help explain the assignments.

There are two types of assignments. Starred assignments are credit/no credit. They're all process assignments toward your main projects. The other assignments are coding exercises that relate to what you learned in the module. Please turn in your assignments in the assignment post. 


Grading:
I do my grading in the evenings, and I like to go through and grade a whole set of assignments at once. When an assignment is due, the thread is locked and I will go through and grade the entire thread. I'll unlock the thread once the grades are set.

This course moves very quickly and so late work will only put you behind for the next module. For each day an assignment is past due, I will penalize one letter grade. I will give feedback on late starred project assignments but they will still receive no-credit. Also, I will only accept work up to 1 module late. So you can't turn in late module 3 work when we're already in module 5.



First steps:
- Purchase your hosting/domain name. You'll need to upload your Assignment 1.1 to your own server.
- Please do the reading! The book is very helpful regarding coding concepts. The module content is meant to supplement and to add more visual/content instruction. 

I hope you enjoy this course!
Yukiko
