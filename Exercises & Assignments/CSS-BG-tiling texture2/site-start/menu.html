			<h2>Beers on tap: $3 per 24oz glass 'Pint+'</h2>
			<h3>Beer Sampler - $6</h3>
			<p>Beer is like a lot of things in life, sometimes you want it all. Thankfully with beer, we can help. Our sampler has a 12oz glass for each of our beers and an unlimited heaping of our chips and salsa, to help you prepare for the next glass. It's rather hard to beat.<p>

			<h3>Bear Beer</h3>
			<p>This dark amble ale that showcases our fantastic barley and the skill of our roasters. It's complex with a bit of roasted sweetness up front and a barley flavor on the finish. Pair it with a steak for a real treat.</p>
			
			<h3>The White Beer</h3>
			<p>A Belgian style wheat beer, our White beer is made with wheat, oats and a special blend of fruits and spices. Think about it as a fun beer, cheerful, complex, and playful.</p>
			
			<h3>An Ale for the Masses</h3>
			<p>This is our staple beer. An ale that is brewed with so much care that it manages to win taste buds the world over. It's simple, starting with a nice malted barley flavor on the tongue and cascade hops in the nose; and finishing with a bit of satisfying bitterness on the back of the palette. Pair it with a burger, we dare you.</p>
			
			<h3>A serious IPA</h3>
			<p>IPA's have gotten a bit of a bad treatment recently. All hops and no beers is what we taste. So we set out to fix it. Our IPA show cases our hops without crushing your tongue in the bitterness. Sip it an savor, it took a lot of effort to figure this one out.</p>
			
			<h3>Don't doubt the stout</h3>
			<p>Dark beers are like music, the one you like will sometimes make your parents cry. We aren't afraid of this, so instead of making a beer that everyone will like, but no one will love, we made a true dark beer most will love. If you don't like it, send it back and we'll give you a pint of your choice for free. So it's risk free, unlike music and your parents.</p>
