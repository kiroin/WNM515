		<!-- begin story -->
		<div class="story">
			<p>Brian Douglas and Josh Merchant founded Awesome Haus brewery in 2002 after meeting in through a mutual friend and legendary master brewer, Charles Bamforth.</p>
			<p>Both Brian and Josh graduated from UC Davis in 2000, Brian with a master's degree in brewing, Josh with a master's degree in business. After a few years of working in private industry, Brian was looking for a way to push his experience making his own brew. After talking with Charles Bamforth, he connected Brian with Josh, a business man who was looking for a new challenge. With both Josh and Brian being passionate about beer, a brewpub became the perfect adventure.</p>
			<p>After the initial launch in 2002, Awesome Haus became a quick success. Brian's brews and unequal demand for quality won the tasters while Josh's aggressive pricing won the patrons. With income steady and patrons happy, Brian and Josh decided to expand, and in 2005 they started serving the best brews to a new location in North Berkeley. Even with tough competition from Pyramid Breweries and Trumer Pils Brauerei, Awesome Haus brews continued to win the hearts of fans both in the restaurant and in the stores.</p>
			
			<p>After nearly 10 years of awesome brews, Awesome Haus Brewery is still innovating on your palette with the best brews and food around. Join us and have a good time.</p>
			
			<p>P.S. For those of you who love our story, mention this for 10% off your bill.</p>
			
			<p>Brewing you the best,<br><em>Brian and Josh</em></p>
