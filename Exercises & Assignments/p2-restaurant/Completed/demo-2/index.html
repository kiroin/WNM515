			<h2>Beer news</h2>		
			<h3>Update: National Hops Shortage</h3>
			<p><em>4-20-2011</em><br>No one is escaping the national hops shortage, not even us. With the nations hops crop suffering from the freezing temperatures still affecting the north, our supply of hops is beginning to dry low. Thankfully fellow brewers like Samuel Adams are helping others, like us, get through. Thanks to Samuel Adams, we'll continue to give you the same brews at the same prices. </p>
			
			<h3>Brewers use copper too</h3>
			<p><em>4-8-2011</em><br>The price of copper doesn't just affect your computer, it also affects the brewers. With the price of copper on the rise, the copper fermenters we use to brew our a beers are getting more and more difficult to find. And since our San Francisco Brewery looking to add more brewing capacity, we'll have to keep our eyes to find good deals. If one of our patrons happens to find a deal, don't hesitate to let us know.  </p>
			
			<h3>NBA Beer competition Coming Up  </h3>
			<p><em>4-2-2011</em><br>The National Brewing Association is holding it's national beer competition next week. We will be competing with our White Beer, Ale for the Masses and Don't doubt the stout. In 2008, 2009 and 2010 we took home the silver medal for our White Beer and this year we hope our White Beer will bring us Gold. Wish us luck!</p>
